\section{Justification For and  Nature of Proposed Changes}

\subsection{Justification for changes}

The reason to update this system is because the Partial Foods is having too 
much checkout IDLE on regular days you usually do not need to operate all of 
the checkouts but there are cases that get saturated and there are too many 
clients to supply the demand. \newline

From a business perspective also doesn’t make sense to all of the cashiers 
operating the checkout if there is not enough demand. \newline

The new system would require less hardware, not need a cashier to be operated 
since the users are the ones who would be doing the checkout, since it takes 
less space we could add more of them and also the 
lines would be faster. \newline


\subsection{Description of desired changes}

The capabilities that are going to be added is to enable customers to operate 
the machine itself, since the users are doing the entire checkout workflow 
we are going to remove the carrier band.  \newline

We are going to add a bagging area and a security scale, we are going to 
remove the cash registers and we are only going to accept credit/debit cards, 
smart-cards and NFC/Mobile Payment methods, we are not 
going to accept cash.  \newline

Initially we are going to keep the two systems and gradually will be replacing 
the previous system with self-checkout machines, in the end we are going to 
have 4 cash registers with the old system and the rest is going to be replaced 
with the new system.  \newline

We are going to start with 5 people to monitor the self-checkout system and 
also assist customers with the new system but gradually they are going to be 
3 people monitoring.  \newline

Two times during the month a company is going to come to do maintenance to the 
machines, the first time is going to maintain half of the machines and the 
second time will take care of the rest.  \newline


\subsection{Priorities among changes}

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Changes considered but not included}
We consider installing a face-recognition software to speed up the process 
for the loyalty card system but the development and cost wouldn’t make 
it cost effective.\newline

We consider asking the users their email address so we can send the receipt 
via email and also collect their emails for marketing campaigns but it would 
require that we have a reliable internet connection and we would have to 
aintain the infrastructure.\newline
