\section{Justification For and  Nature of Proposed \newline Changes}

\subsection{Justification for changes}

The reason to update this system is because Partial Foods is having too 
many checkout idle machines on regular days you usually do not
need to operate all of the checkouts but there are cases where we have to
many costumers and not enough staff to operate the machines. 
\newline

\noindent
From a business perspective also doesn’t make sense to all of the cashiers 
operating the checkout if there is not enough demand. 
\newline

\noindent
The new system would require less hardware, not need for a cashier since the 
costumers are the ones who would be doing the checkout, it takes less space 
meaning that we could add more SOC (self-checkout) machine and also the lines 
would be faster. 
\newline

\subsection{Description of desired changes}

The capabilities that are going to be added is to enable customers to operate 
the machine by themselves, because they are going to do the entire 
checkout workflow.  
\newline

\noindent
We will remove the carrier band. 
\newline

\noindent
We are going to add a bagging area and a security scale, we are going to 
remove the cash registers and we are only going to accept credit/debit cards, 
smart-cards and NFC/Mobile Payment methods, we are not 
going to accept cash.  
\newline

\noindent
Initially we are going to keep the two systems and gradually will be replacing 
the previous system with self-checkout machines, in the end we are going to 
have 4 cash registers with the old system and the rest is going to be replaced 
with the new system.  
\newline

\noindent
We are going to start with 5 people to monitor the self-checkout system and 
also assist customers with the new system but gradually they are going to be 
3 people monitoring.  
\newline

\noindent
Two times during the month a company is going to come to do maintenance to the 
machines, the first time is going to maintain half of the machines and the 
second time will take care of the rest.

\subsection{Changes considered but not included}

We consider installing a face-recognition software to speed up the process 
for the loyalty card system but the development and cost wouldn’t make 
it cost effective.
\newline

\noindent
We consider asking the users their email address so we can send the receipt 
via email and also collect their emails for marketing campaigns but it would 
require that we have a reliable internet connection and we would have to 
maintain that infrastructure.
