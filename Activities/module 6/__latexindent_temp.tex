\section{User Stories}
\subsection{Costumer}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item As the customer, I want to pay with credit card because i don’t want 
        to carry cash and i want the credit card rewards (Step 7.c)
        \item As the customer, I want to pay with debit card because i don’t 
        want to carry cash and also i don’t want to spend 
        more than i have (Step 7.c)
        \item As the customer, I do not want to wait in long lines to checkout.
        \item As the customer, I want to pay in cash so i don’t get in 
        debt by using credit cards (Step b.c)
        \item As the customer, I would want the system to be able to apply any 
        coupons I have or any current discounts on any of my items 
        so I can save as much money as possible.
        \item As the customer, I would want the system to accurately 
        calculate my owed change so that I don’t overpay. (Step 7.a)
    \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
