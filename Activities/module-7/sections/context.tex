\section{Context}

Your company, Narrow World of Sports (NWS), broadcasts and records all types of 
sporting events. Some events are low-cost, such as high school basketball games, 
while other events (e.g., Super Bowl, World Cup) require a lot of planning and 
processing. NWS sells live broadcasts and recorded events to customers through 
an online streaming service. Customers may sign up for different levels of 
service based on the types of features they use. For example, some customers 
just want to see live events as they might be broadcast on TV, while others 
want the ability to watch more than one perspective at the same time 
on split-screen displays.
