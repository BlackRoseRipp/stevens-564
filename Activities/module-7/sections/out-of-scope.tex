\section{Out-of-scope features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textit{Multi-track} volume control}: Enables the user to 
    control multiple track audio in any particular \textit{stream}. E.g In a 
    particular \textit{stream} the user can set the audio of the commentators 
    in a lower volume and increase the audio from the cameras.
    \item \textbf{\textit{PiP} support for \textit{multi-source stream}}: Have 
    a main \textit{stream} open and have a second \textit{stream} from another 
    game in \textit{PiP}.
    \item \textbf{\textit{Multicam} with \textit{split-screen}}: Enable users 
    to do a \textit{split screen} and see two different angles from the game at 
    the same time.
    \item \textbf{\textit{Overlay effects} in live streams}: Add overlay 
    effects for events that are live stream.
    \item \textbf{On-demand live instant replay, using Shadow Play techniques}: 
    During the live \textit{stream} we do not support doing \textit{instant 
    replay} if the stream is a livestream.
    \item \textbf{Support for localization for commentators in live stream}: 
    Offer different languages from commentators.
    \item \textbf{\textit{Multi-source stream} support}: Users watch two or more 
    \textit{streams} at the same time.
