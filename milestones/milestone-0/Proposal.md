## Bidding platform for freelancers

Program where a person submit a project for a particular price and freelancers start bidding for how much they are willing to do the project.

## Marketplace for used books

A marketplace where students can buy and sell used books. In college most people use the same book for the same class and they will not used it again in their career, why spent more money if you can resell it to another student.

## Courier Service App

Application where people can request to send a package to another person that are in a particular area.
