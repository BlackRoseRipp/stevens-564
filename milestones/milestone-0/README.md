When creating a project idea, the team should think about feasibility and profitability. The team must describe each idea in one or more paragraphs. The team should clarify the context, the overall purpose and the business value of the proposed project. 

In serving as the customer of the project your team will answer any questions from the BA/RE team throughout the semester. 

## What happens after this assignment?

The instructor will review the proposals and pick a preferred project idea from each team. All project ideas will then be posted online. All the teams will bid on the project ideas. First come first serve. The biding process forms the binding between customer team and BA/RE team.

Through the rest of the semester, each team will create a comprehensive requirement specification for the project being chosen.
