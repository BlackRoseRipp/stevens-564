\section{Bidding platform for freelancers}
\subsection{Context}
A lot of people have tasks that they would like to perform but either they
are too busy or too lazy to do them. The goal of this project is to creative
a platform where people can submits tasks or project they want and how much
are they willing to pay for it. 

Other people can bid on how much they are willing to be paid to perfom that
task, then the person who post the task is going to choose a person from the 
people who bit and that person is going to do the task.

\subsection{Purpose}
Enable people to outsource their tasks, chores or projects.

\subsection{Business value}
People who post the project could get a more cheap option since there is 
competition, and people who have the time and skills are able to make some 
money, and as a hosting platform we charge a fee for posting the job and a 
service fee for every transaction.

\section{Marketplace for used books}
\subsection{Context}
You are in College, you finish your courses, you get your A's, now what do 
you do with your text books? You keep some, but there are one that you bought
and you know you are never going to use them again, why not sell them?

\subsection{Purpose}
If you are in a University you course material do not change frequently so
the next generation of students probably are going to use exactly the same 
book, instead of making the publishing companies richer why don't you help 
save the enviroment by donating or selling you used books.

\subsection{Business value}
Students who sell them get some money back, students who buy them get a book 
for a cheap price, the enviroment also benefits, and for the platform? 1 dolar
per post, just to keep lights on.
