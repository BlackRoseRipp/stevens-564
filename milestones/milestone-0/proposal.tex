\section{Bidding platform for freelancers}
\subsection{Context}
A lot of people have tasks that they would like to perform but either they are 
too busy or too lazy to do them. The goal of this project is to create a 
platform where people can submit tasks or projects they want and how much 
they are willing to pay for it. 

Other people can bid on how much they are willing to be paid to perform that 
task, then the person who posts the task is going to choose a person from the 
people who bid and that person is going to do the task.

\subsection{Purpose}
Enable people to outsource their tasks, chores or projects.

\subsection{Business value}
People  who  post  the  project  could  get  a  cheaper  option  since  there  
is competition, and people who have the time and skills are able to make some 
money, and as a hosting platform we charge a fee for posting the job and 
a service fee for every transaction.

\section{Marketplace for used books}
\subsection{Context}
You are in College, you finish your courses, you get your A’s, now what do you 
do with your textbooks?  You keep some, but there is one that you bought and 
you know you are never going to use them again, why not sell them?

\subsection{Purpose}
If you are in a University your course material does not change frequently so 
the next generation of students probably are going to use exactly the same 
book, instead of making the publishing companies richer why don’t you help 
save the environment by donating or selling your used books.

\subsection{Business value}
Students who sell them get some money back, students who buy them get a book 
for a cheap price, the environment also benefits, and for the platform? We get 
money for each transaction.

\section{Courier Service App}
\subsection{Context}
You have some time that you need to send urgently,  it is not a big package,  
it is the size of the envelope, you can request a courier service to send a 
package in a specific radius for a specific price.

\subsection{Purpose}
Enable people to send packages without the need to fill out a form, wait 
inline or go to a specific place to send a package nearby.

\subsection{Business value}
We enable people to make money on the side and the platform collects a 
fee on each transaction.
