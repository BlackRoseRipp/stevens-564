\section{Business Requeriments}
\subsection{Background}
This projects comes from the increasing need to get items directly to our 
step door, right now with COVID it's a risk to go to the store to do our own
groceries, also this application will help people that live in cities where 
is very difficult to get parking or for people who don't own a car. 

This application will be convenient for people that are busy most of the time
like people who work full-time, for families that have young children,
elderly or disabled people that would be an inconvinience to drive to the 
store, stand in line and carry the items back to their house.

\subsection{Business Opportunity}
This application is target to a demographic that has disposable income and 
would like to receive same day delivery. In the current market we have 
companies like Grubhub/Uber Eats, but this are targeting mostly food-chains.

Other giant in the market is Amazon, they have the biggest catalog of products
but they do not offer same day delivery in all the cities, our biggest 
competitor would be Postmates.

For the initial phase of the project our main target would be the boutique 
stores, that kind of stores that are not big enough to have their own delivery
service and can take advantage to increase their reach by using our service.

\subsection{Business Objectives}
- Comply with federal and state regulations
- Be the fastest platform for deliverying order
- Be rated as the most privacy focus application 
- Be rated as the fastest application for fulfilling orders
- Develop a big catalog of products that surpass the one offered by Postmates
- Achieve good costumer satisfaction

\subsection{Sucess Metrics}
