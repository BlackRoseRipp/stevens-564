\section{Analysis}
\subsection{Mission Statement, Key Drivers, Key Constraints}
The goal for the meeting was to determine:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is their motivation to create this project?
    \item What problem in the market do they want to fulfill?
    \item How do they want to achieve this?
    \item What is the business model?
    \item How big is the market for this project, short and long term?
    \item Who are their competitors?
    \item What is their product differentiator?
    \item What kind of constraints do they have, either time, 
    technological or monetary?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent We had a meeting in a free form setting, brainstorm, so the customers could 
provide their insight without any specific agenda, sometimes one or more of the 
people in the group focused on an area in particular and we moved the 
conversation over that topic.

\subsection{Key Stakeholders, User Requirements, Business Requirements}
Once we established why the client would like to develop this project we went 
ahead and tried to figure out who are the stakeholders, what is the scope of 
the project and what business goals are they trying to achieve. \newline

The goal for the meeting was to determine:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How many stakeholders are in the project?
    \item How the project would help the stakeholders to interact with each other?
    \item What are their business goals in the short, medium and long term?
    \item Identify the motivator for each of the stakeholders
    \item How many applications are going to be built?
    \item What functionalities do each stakeholder want? 
    \item Seize what is the scale on which the program is going to run in the short, medium and long term
    \item What is their budget?
    \item What is their go to market timeline?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent We sent the clients a document with the questions that we had from 
the previous meeting, some were to make sure that we understood their 
motivation, others were to get clarification because some of the replies 
seemed ambiguous.\newline

\noindent We used an interview approach to get these clarifications, this 
process was quick so we moved the conversation towards getting to know what is 
their current status regarding resources and constraints, what is their budget, 
what is their business goals, how much traffic they were expecting.\newline

\noindent We use this information to create their business requirements. Once 
we have these we start talking about the key stakeholders for the program. What 
was their motivation? What is their demographic? what is their social-economic 
status? How are they solving their problem right now, and how the project 
would improve the existing solution.\newline

\noindent We move from a interview forma towards brainstorming, we want to open 
the scope as much as possible to have place for creativity insight and during 
the conversation we move the conversations in a way that would narrow the scope 
of those idea, we achieve this by discarting ideas that were not feasible, 
either from a technological perspective or time constraints.

\pagebreak

\noindent With this we identify the key stakeholders, and then we start 
discussing what kind of functionalities each of these stakeholders would want 
to achieve with the program, this was still in a brainstorming format. We used 
this information to generate the User Requirements.

\subsection{System Requirements, Security Requirements, Quality Requirements}
With the information from the previous meeting some problem arises, there was 
conflict in some of their requirements, we take notices of those and we put 
them in a document that we sent to them before the meeting. 

The goal for the meeting was to determine:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Clarification of the conflicting requirements
    \item Use case validation
    \item Quality attributes
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Performance
        \item Accessibility 
        \item Usability
        \item Security
    \end{itemize}
    \item How many platforms are going to be develop?
    \item What kind of constraints do they have regarding providers?
    \item What kind of compliance the software requires?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent From the previous meeting we know what is the goal and motivation 
for the stakeholders, and also how they interact with one another, now the 
focus is moving towards how can we achieve those expectations using software. 

\noindent We as a team already have an idea on how the project could be 
implemented and which providers to use to achieve it. We have the meeting in a 
free form format but behind the scenes we were giving suggestions on how the 
system could be implemented and their clients either agree or usually provide 
alternatives. With this information we layout how many platforms 
would be required. \newline

\noindent Now it is time to transform these user requirements into system 
requirements, we start asking them questions about what the process should be 
and ask them on how the system should behave in case the system reaches a 
particular edge case. During the conversation we ask questions on how to 
validate if this use case was executed successfully, these were the 
foundations for the quality requirements.

\noindent Once we understood how can we verify if the requirements were 
successful or not, we move the conversations towards how good this were 
supposed to be, we start asking questions about:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How fast X should be able to perform
    \item How many steps should happen to achieve a particular use case?
    \item How should we do data validation?
    \item What is the expected uptime for a particular system?
    \item When are the expected peak hours, if any?
\end{itemize}

\noindent We take these notes and create a formal representation of these requirements 
using the grammar used in the textbook.
