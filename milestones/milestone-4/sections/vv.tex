\section{Verification \& Validation}
\subsection{Verification}
\noindent By the end of the project we created a document with all the system 
requirements, quality attributes, security requirements, constraints and 
diagrams, and we set up a meeting with the customers and together we reviewed 
them one by one to make sure that we didnâ€™t miss any requirements.

\noindent We also do some remarks regarding some requirements that were not 
feasible and we provide the customer with some requirements that were more 
realistic, which they agreed.

\subsection{Validation}

TBD Add the dialog maps
